## Quick Start

ContextVM provides a powerful framework for context-controlled computation on the Nostr network. Our SDK enables developers to:

- **Create secure contexts** for identity and application management
- **Build distributed applications** with trustless architecture
- **Integrate with Nostr** seamlessly through our transport layers
- **Manage cryptographic signing** with extensible signer interfaces
- **Handle relay operations** through our relay handler implementations

Ready to start building? Check out our [Quick Overview](/guides/getting-started/quick-overview/) to get up and running.
